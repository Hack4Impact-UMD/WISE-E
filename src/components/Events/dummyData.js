The video conference was performed with the belief that an on-site phase would occur to enforce earlier lessons. This did not occur based on escalating COVID concerns on the island. Recently we were contacted by our University of Hawaii partner who started that the on-site portion was being rescheduled and the on-site training could possibly take place in late November.`,
